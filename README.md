# Template Matching for Signal Processing

This project focuses on extracting information from a signal using convolutional filters and was undertaken as part of the Signals and Systems class in the second semester of RT3. It's implemented using MATLAB.

For a detailed explanation of the tweeks (a pattern in the signal) and methods of extraction utilized in this project, please refer to the following document: [Explanation of Tweeks and Methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHfLVX9UKPMm4dI6bxkBkf2XY0UZDSb31kzp6eE_AE8/edit?usp=sharing)
